## 🎮 Simon Says Game

This is a browser-based **Simon Says game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The game challenges players to memorize and repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors and sounds. Each round, a new color is added to the sequence, and the user must click the correct order to progress.

### 🧠 Features:
- Interactive UI with color buttons and sound effects
- Increasing difficulty with each level
- Real-time user input validation
- Game over alert with reset option
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

This project demonstrates the use of **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **basic game logic** in JavaScript.
